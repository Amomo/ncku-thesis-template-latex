\hspace{5mm}As the early stage of
physical design, the floorplanning quality has dramatic impacts on
the chip performance. In this work, we proposed a high-quality
bus-driven floorplanning algorithm considering the practical
impacts of the bus pins. The experimental results show that our
floorplanner outperforms than the state-of-the-art floorplanner
\cite{Ma08} in all aspects. The experimental results
show that our algorithm still performs well in larger testcases.
The future work lies in extending our
algorithm to handle other practical constraints such as
fixed-outline, thermal effect, and etc.
