Also provide some more feature for the library is needed, such as multi-table joining operation in SQL, graph database (like Neo4j\cite{web:neo4j:home-page}, by using different back-end database rather than a fixed storage engine), decision tree, similarity (like Lucene \cite{web:wiki:lucene}), etc. These feature are very basic and common that should become very useful in many field, such as information retrieval and data mining.\\
