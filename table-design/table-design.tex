The target of Li's Hash is to provide a similar usage of relational database to user who can use the non-relational database as the back-end, so that the table design in relational database is needed in Li's Hash. By combining the data type which has introduced before that can become a table which the concept is show as figure \ref{fig:table_design:example}:

\label{fig:table_design:example}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:table_design:example} shows a example of simple membership data-base, the user who using the Li's Hash that will see the view as a normal relational database, but the table is builded by the Li's Hash which do the indexing and store all data into the back-end database just like figure shows.\\

%This is the target that the Li's Hash want to provide for the users.

%table for the user, from the relational databases design \cite{web:mysql:sql-syntax-identifiers,web:sqlite:limits,web:postgresql:sql-syntax-identifiers} which seem normally to set the maximum length of table and column name as 63~64 or no limited. So the maximum length should be 255 for the names which should enough for many user, also plus the length of database's name (for application that multiuser using a single backend database) and the key's length (255 as the other non-relational databases), it should be at least 1000,
