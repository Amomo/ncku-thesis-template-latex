\subsubsection{Selection}

Select operation is the simplest operation than the other, because the selection for \textit{BOOLEAN} type is only can select $"true"$ or $"false"$, so select the bucket then this will return the whole bucket, so this is also a quick operation. Also if user want to retrieve all, just retrieve both $"true"$ and $"false"$ bucket will get all data. That time complexity of both searching are $O(1)$.
